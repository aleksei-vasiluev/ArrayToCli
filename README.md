class ArrayToCli allows you to convert the elements of the array into a text representation with a tabular delimitation of elements. To run this class, you need to include in your code an include command with a file reference to the class: "class.ArrayToCli.php".

Example: $massive = ['pavel', 'petya', 'aleksei'];

include 'https://github.com/aleksei-vasiluev/ArrayToCli/blob/master/ArrayToCli.php';
